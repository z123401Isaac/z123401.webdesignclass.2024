        The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom[b] is a 2023 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The player controls Link as he searches for Princess Zelda and fights to prevent Ganondorf from destroying Hyrule. Tears of the Kingdom retains the open-world gameplay and setting of its predecessor, Breath of the Wild (2017), and features new environments including the Sky, an area composed of floating islands, and an expansive cavern beneath Hyrule known as the Depths. The player has access to various devices that aid combat or exploration, and which can be used to construct vehicles.

Tears of the Kingdom was conceived after ideas for Breath of the Wild downloadable content had exceeded its scope. Development was led by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division with Breath of the Wild director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma reprising their roles. The developers were inspired by social media posts to create gameplay mechanics that encouraged experimentation and sometimes struggled to differentiate the sequel from its predecessor. A teaser was shown at E3 2019, while a full reveal featuring gameplay was shown at E3 2021. Tears of the Kingdom was initially planned to release in 2022 but was delayed until May 2023 so that the developers could refine it.

Tears of the Kingdom received acclaim. Critics praised the expanded world, new powers, scale, and story; criticism focused on its voice acting and technical performance. It sold more than 10 million copies in its first three days of release and over 20.61 million copies by March 2024, making it one of the best-selling games on the Nintendo Switch.
