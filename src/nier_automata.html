      Nier: Automata is a 2017 action role-playing game developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. It is a sequel to Nier (2010), itself a spin-off of and sequel to the Drakengard series. Nier: Automata was originally released for the PlayStation 4 and Windows via Steam, and an Xbox One port was published the following year. A Nintendo Switch port was released in 2022.

      Nier: Automata is set during a proxy war between alien-created Machines and human-crafted androids, focusing on the actions of combat android 2B, scanner android 9S, and rogue prototype A2. The story requires multiple playthroughs, with each playthrough revealing new story elements. The gameplay combines role-playing elements with action-based hack-and-slash combat. It also includes gameplay from other video game genres, with elements varying from shoot 'em up to text adventure.
      
      Production began in 2014, with series creator Yoko Taro, producer Yosuke Saito, and lead composer Keiichi Okabe reprising their roles in Nier. Akihiko Yoshida, known for his work in the Final Fantasy series, led character design. The goal was to make a sequel game that would be faithful to Nier while improving the combat system. Because the project was new to PlatinumGames, its staff faced multiple challenges when developing the gameplay and open-world environment. The story, which was written by Yoko, explores themes of finding value in life and the reasons people kill.
      
      Nier: Automata was announced at E3 2015; it received stage plays and novels expanding its narrative, and both downloadable content (DLC) and crossovers with other games were issued after its release. The game was localized by 8-4, translators of Nier. Critics praised the game's story, themes, gameplay, and music, but gave criticism for some visual and technical problems. The PC release drew a mixed response due to technical issues that were not officially addressed until 2021. Sales surpassed expectations and as of February 2024, the game had shipped 8 million copies worldwide.
